## Overview
---
**Techtronix Innovation** is a leader in the microchip and robotics industry, seeking to address inefficiencies in sales strategies, inventory planning, and market growth. Despite a strong presence across the automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial sectors, the company struggled with demand unpredictability and inconsistent profitability. To support data-driven decision-making, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on a full yearâ€™s transaction data, covering sales figures, customer demographics, product details, and financial metrics.

The project analysed company-wide transactional data to assess sales trends, customer behaviour, inventory alignment, profitability, and regional performance. Insights revealed microchips as the top earners, the industrial sector as the most profitable, and the Asia-Pacific region as the most lucrative. High-cost, low-profit products were flagged, while customer and seasonal patterns informed planning. Strategic recommendations focused on optimising production, market-specific pricing, and expanding in high-performing regions.
